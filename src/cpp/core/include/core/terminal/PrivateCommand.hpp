/*
 * The PrivateCommand class is used by terminal to silently run a command in the terminal
 * without the user seeing the input or output. It only runs if the terminal has no child
 * processes and if the user doesn't seem to be in the middle of typing a command.
 *
 * Host must frequently call onTryCapture() to possibly fire the command, userInput() so
 * PrivateCommand can analyze if user has entered a command or is potentially in the middle of
 * typing a command, and output() to let PrivateCommand analyze output from a private command
 * it issued so it capture it and end the private-command mode.
 *
 * If oncePerUserCommand is true, the private command will only run after the user has hit
 * <enter>, so has potentially run a command. It will not run again until user has hit
 * <enter> again. Idea here is to only capture changes that can be made by a user command, such
 * as changing the environment.
 *
 * If oncePerUserCommand is false, then the private command can run as often as every
 * privateCommandTimeoutMs.
 *
 * Once PrivateCommand::hasCaptured() returns false, the output of the private command is available
 * via getPrivateOutput().
