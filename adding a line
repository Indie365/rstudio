Hi, I got a problem with adding a line with a density function of chi square to my histagram . How can i add that? Im a newbie into r 
x=1000
hist(rchisq(x,3),xlim=c(0,15),type="l")
lines(x,dchisq(x,3),xlim=c(0,15),type="l")

I have to generate 1000 values of chi square  with df=3 and put them on histogram with xlim 0-15, then add a line with a density function with the same df.
