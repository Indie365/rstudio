### Python

- RStudio attempts to infer the appropriate version of Python when "Automatically activate project-local Python environments" is checked and the user has not requested a specific version of Python. This Python will be stored in the environment variable "RETICULATE_PYTHON_FALLBACK", available from the R console, the Python REPL, and the RStudio Terminal (#9990)
- Shiny for Python apps now display a "Run App" button on the Source editor toolbar. (Requires `shiny` Python package v0.2.7 or later.)

### Quarto

- Support for v2 format of Quarto crossref index

### Posit Workbench

- Adds `-l` (long) option to `rserver-url`. When `/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver-url -l <port number>` is executed within a VS Code or Jupyter session, the full URL where a user can view a server proxied at that port is displayed (rstudio-pro#3620)
- Sets the `UVICORN_ROOT_PATH` environment variable to the proxied port URL for port 8000 in VS Code and Jupyter sessions, allowing FastAPI applications to run without additional configuration. (rstudio-pro#2660)

- Introduce Workbench Job management to VS Code Extension (rstudio/rstudio-pro#3784, rstudio/rstudio-pro#3565)
