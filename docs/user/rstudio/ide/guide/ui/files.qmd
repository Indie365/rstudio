title: "Managing Files"
---

RStudio supports syntax highlighting and other specialized code-editing features for specific file types:

- Scripts in R, Python, SQL  
- Computational and scientific documents in Quarto, RMarkdown, and TeX  
- Web content such as HTML and CSS  
- and many more  

## File Menu

To create a new file you use the **File -\> New File** menu:

An alternative workflow is to use the visual elements in the RStudio menu.

To open an existing file, use either the **File -\> Open File\...** menu or the **Recent Files** menu to select from recently opened files.

## Files tab

The **Output** pane has a **Files** tab that includes several buttons for managing files within the currently selected folder, including the **New Blank File** dropdown, **Delete** button, and the **Rename** button. These buttons will operate on files that are selected within the **Files tab**.

## Switching files

If several files are opened within RStudio, then they are all available as tabs within the **Source** pane to facilitate quick switching between open documents. If there are a large number of open documents, navigate between them using the "**\>\>"** icon at the end of the tab bar or the **View -\> Switch to Tab\...**) menu item:

To quickly navigate to an existing file in the current RStudio Project use the <kbd>Ctrl + .</kbd> shortcut. Entering the shortcut will bring up the **Go to File/Function** search bar with auto-completion of file names.
